      <p><strong>SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, June 7</strong></p>
  		<p>As the 155-millimeter howitzer shells whistled down on this
    crumbling city today, exploding thunderously into buildings all around, a disheveled,
    stubble-bearded man in formal evening attire unfolded a plastic chair in the middle
    of Vase Miskina Street. He lifted his cello from its case and began playing
    Albinoni's Adagio.</p>

    <p>There were only two people to hear him, and both fled,
    dodging from doorway to doorway, before the performance ended.</p>

    <p>Each day at 4 P.M., the cellist, Vedran Smailovic, walks to
    the same spot on the pedestrian mall for a concert in honor of Sarajevo's dead.</p>

    <p>The spot he has chosen is outside the bakery where several
    high-explosive rounds struck a bread line 12 days ago, killing 22 people and wounding
    more than 100. If he holds to his plan, there will be 22 performances before his
    gesture has run its course.</p>
